## Catacomb

### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/catacomb) by Alexandra Tinsley

### Yarn
Cascade 220 Superwash Aran - Maroon

### Status
Finished

### Modifications
None

### Notes
For my March hat, I wanted to pick a stitch pattern with a nice texture.  The last hat I knit was a little more
veriegated than I'd like.
