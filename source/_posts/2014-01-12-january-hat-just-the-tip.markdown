### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/just-the-tip) by Alexandra Tinsley

### Yarn
Manos del Uruguay Maxima - Shocking  
Manos del Uruguay Maxima - Slate

Purchased at [Eat.Sleep.Knit](http://eatsleepknit.com)

### Modifications
None, but the pompom turned out bigger than intended

### Notes
As soon as Alex Tinsley tweeted her new pattern, [Just the Tip](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/just-the-tip), 
I new this was the hat I wanted to make for January.
I accidentally ended up buying three other patterns at the same time: 
[Rooty](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/rooty), 
[A Most Bespeckled Hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/a-most-bespeckled-hat),
and
[Chutes, and also Ladders](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/chutes-and-also-ladders).  I'm pretty
excited about making all of them.

One reason I was really excited about knitting this pattern was because I needed a reason to use up some of my
leftover neon pink yarn that I bought for my [Safety Scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/safety-scarf).
I didn't want to knit anything that used hot pink as the main color, so this hat is perfect.

This is currently my favorite hat!
