The [instructions](https://www.inkling.com/read/cast-on-bind-off-54-step-by-step-methods-leslie-ann-bestor-1st/stretchy-bind-offs/icelandic-bind-off)
 I've previously  used for the Icelandic Bind Off came from an online preview
of this book, so I decided to go ahead and buy it.  I’ve heard the title 
recommended often enough to know that it’s a good reference, and it really is 
helpful. It shows you how to do each technique and advises when to use each one.
 I wish all my knitting books were spiral bound like this one.
