I wasn't planning to participate in this year's [Ravellenic Games](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravellenic-winter-games-2014).
 I really wasn't.  I've never paid attention to the games in previous 
years, so I wasn't even sure what was involved other than people form 
teams for it. This year I ended up planning to earn a few medals at the
 very last minute.

Initially, I just wanted to give to a good cause.  [Alex Tinsley](http://dull-roar.com)
announced she was donating a portion of every colorwork purchase to the
International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, and I figured that
since I wanted to buy some of these patterns anyway, today is the day to
give her my money.  I'm planning to knit more of her hats when I knit a hat
each month, and I can probably knit *only* Dull Roar hats for the entire 
year.  It's very likely that will happen.

After lots of pondering and looking at pictures, I decided to add 
[Varia](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/varia), 
[Zam Hat](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/zam-hat),
[Snoway](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snoway),
and [Petoncle](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/petoncle)
to my library.  

I was very happy with my impulsive pattern purchases (as I always am), and
I started planning which hat I want to knit for February.  I settled on Varia
for reasons that I'll write about later, but Petoncle is similar enough that
I may switch to it depending on the colors I have.  

It occurred to me that *surely*
there is something in the Ravellenic Games that requires me to knit a hat.
I can knit hats all day.  I went to the [Ravellenic Games](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravellenic-winter-games-2014)
group on Ravelry and looked at the [events](http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravellenic-winter-games-2014/pages/Events-List-and-Descriptions).
Not only was there a hat event, but there are quite a few events that fit 
projects I was planning to knit anyway!  Of course there are more events
I wish I had time to do as well, but I'm attempting to be reasonable.

###The green events this year

- Aerial Unwind
- Alpine Abode Enhancement
- Bag Jump
- Cross Cowling
- Flying Camel Spin
- Free Dance
- Giant Slalom-ghan
- Hat Halfpipe
- Mitten Moguls
- Scarf Super-G
- Short Track Shawls
- Sidecountry Challenge
- Sock Hockey
- Sweaterboard Cross
- Toy Tobogganing
- WIPs Dancing

### I intend to complete

- WIPs Dancing: Finish a pair of [Thoroughbred](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/thoroughbred) 
fingerless gloves on my needles
- Aerial Unwind: Frog my unfinished [Color Craving](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/color-craving)
- Hat Halfpipe: [Varia](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/varia) 
- Cross Cowling: [Volutissimo](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/volutissimo)
- Free Dancing: Undecided, but I could easily make another bear sweater

### If I have time, I'd also like to complete

- Bag Jump: Design a growler carrier
- Sidecountry Challenge: I ought to figure out what to do with my abandoned
	[Sky Scarf](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/sky-scarf)
- Mitten Moguls: Mittens!

The more I look at the list, the more events I want to do.  I think I can 
accomplish what I want to do for the games, but I also need to continue working
on my Lipsick sweater.  I'm getting close to the section where I need to start
the short rows for the back edge.

Also, I already feel guilty that none of my Ravellenic Games plans involve
working on my Master Knitting packet.  Maybe I should make some changes so I
have Free Dancing or Sidecountry Challenge plans with specific progress 
goals for the program.  I have my materials, but I haven't started working 
on anything yet.
