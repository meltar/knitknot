You can view the original guide on Outfit Posts for this set [here](http://www.outfitposts.com/2012/12/summary-one-suitcase-beach-vacation.html).

The idea is that with sixteen pieces of clothing, you can mix and match them to make forty 
different outfits.

I don't live on the beach, but this looks like a good starting point for the
heat of summers in Atlanta.  The guide is a little outdated, so I'll make 
substitutions when necessary.
