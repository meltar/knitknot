### Notes
I had trouble with this project early on - it was a mysteral knit-a-long, and the amount of 
knitting per week was more than I was able to easily do.  I got behind, and I didn't really
enjoy working on the project.  I found it difficult to knit rows that bent at such an extreme
angle, especially as the rows got longer and longer.  After seeing pictures of the final design,
I'm not sure I'd wear it anyway.
