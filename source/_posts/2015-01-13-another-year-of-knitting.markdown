Well, it's been nearly a year since my last post, but I decided to give
my knitting blog another chance.

I took a look back at my goals for 2014 and was prety disappointed.

- Submit the level 1 of the [TKGA Master Knitting Program](http://www.tkga.com/?page=AboutTKGAMasters) by July 1, 2014
- Knit a new hat each month
- Knit a [bear sweater](http://atlantaknittingguild.org/community-service/bear-sweaters/) each month
- Knit two sweaters
- Document previous projects
- Continue blogging!

I really didn't do anything with my TKGA Master Knitting packet except feel
really overwhelmed. I wish I'd worked on it while I was unemployed last
winter, but since I didn't, I need to dedicate some time to it. I just don't
know when.

I *did* knit a new hat each month - in fact, I knit around fifteen new hats
last year! Many of them have been given away, but I still have more than
half.

It looks like I forgot to keep records, but I think I knit six bear sweaters.
They don't take a long time to knit, but I dislike the extra responsibility
of working on them on a schedule. They're easier to complete in batches, so
I'll just say that I intend to knit some more this year.

Documenting projects is difficult, and I didn't do a good job of it once I 
stopped blogging, but it's really helpful to have information when it's time
to make something similar or knit the same pattern again. I really want to be
more organized, and this is an important piece.

I knit 3/4 of one sweater instead of two sweaters, but I don't feel too bad
about it.  I really want to finish up my Lipstick sweater before spring so
I can wear it though. It shouldn't be too hard now that I just have to work
on the rest of the sleeves.  I also need to apply a stiff fabric to the inside
of the button bands to keep them flat.

### Goals for 2015

It's kind of boring to keep working on the same goals, but I'm hoping to 
become more productive after getting more organized.

Other than finishing my 
[Lipstick](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lipstick) 
project, I'm starting a KAL for a
[Hitofude Cardigan](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/hitofude-cardigan)

I'll post some updates as I work on them.
