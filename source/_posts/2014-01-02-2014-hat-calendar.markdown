I was inspired to knit (at least) one hat per month in 2014 while talking to [Liz Abinante](http://feministy.com/) and [Alex Tinsley](http://www.dull-roar.com/) on Twimtter.
I love knitting hats, and I'd definitely do a year long knit-a-long if it was hat themed and organized by a
designer I like.  I don't think there is one, so I'm making my own.

I think I can accomplish this pretty easily with patterns in my Ravelry library (since apparently there are 171 options)
but if I need any others, I know there are some [Dull Roar](http://www.ravelry.com/designers/alexandra-tinsley) hats (desgined by Alex Tinsley) that urgently need knitting.
