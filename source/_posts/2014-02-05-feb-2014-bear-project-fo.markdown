{% img left /images/posts/2014/2014febbear.JPG bear sweater %}

### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/beary-easy-sweater) by Diana Rishel

### Yarn
Unknown thick and thin cotton blend - light blue
Unknown cotton viscose or bamboo blend - yellow

### Status
Finished

### Modifications
Knit in stripes with two rows per stripe.

### Notes
This sweater was made for the Trauma Bear Project (Knit it Forward progrom through Atlanta Knitting Guild).

I didn't want to get in the habit of procrastinating and never finishing my bear projects, so I
knit a second Beary Easy Sweater.  I can add this to my ever growing pile of things to block.
