[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lipstick) by Joji Locatelli

I really wanted to knit another long or cabled sweater, but I realized I'm short on yardage.  For now, the best
option is knitting a different sweater that uses less yarn. I'd still like to eventually knit either
[L'Acadie Cardigan](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lacadie-cardigan) (probably with narrower
front bands) or [Plowman Cardigan](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/plowman-cardigan) (probably
with modified sleeves).

Still, I'm looking forward to knitting Lipstick.  I'd like to have more short row practice, and I always
love patterns that show off twisted rib.

After doing some research, I need to decide if I want to turn the cardigan into a henley. I probably ought
to stick to the cardigan since I wanted to knit one when I started planning which pattern to choose.  I'm
definitely going to make longer sleeves if I have enough yarn.  I think that's a really useful modification
for winter sweater wearing.

I already wound my yarn, so the next step is learning how to crochet a provisional cast on around the 
needle.
