## Mustard Farthing

### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/farthing) by Jared Flood

### Yarn
HiKoo by Skacel Collection, Inc. American B.R.A.N.D. - Yellowstone

### Status
Finished

### Modifications
None

### Notes
Knit in size small, but I wish I could have been sure that I had enough yarn for the larger size. I have a decent
amount of yarn leftover that would have been nice to use.

I was dumb and put the scarf in water to wet block it before double checking the edges.  I forgot to fix one spot
in the edge before blocking, so I had to handle it afterwards.
