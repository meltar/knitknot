Today is the last day for the games, and I know I won't be finishing the scarf I'm working
on now, so I submitted all the information needed for the events I completed.  It was a
little tedious to submit everything, but it was easy.  Next year I need to remember to 
take note of the time I finished a project as well as the date.  I was able to determine
an approximate time for the projects I completed, but it would have been easier to record
the time in my notes.  It would also be better to enter an event immediately after 
finishing each project rather than waiting until the last minute.  Next time I'll be more
organized.


### I intended to complete

- WIPs Dancing: Finish a pair of [Thoroughbred](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/thoroughbred) 
fingerless gloves on my needles
- Aerial Unwind: Frog my unfinished [Color Craving](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/color-craving)
- Hat Halfpipe: [Varia](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/varia) 
- Cross Cowling: [Volutissimo](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/volutissimo)
- Free Dancing: Undecided, but I could easily make another bear sweater

### I actually completed

- WIPs Dancing: Finish a pair of [Thoroughbred](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/thoroughbred) 
fingerless gloves on my needles
- Aerial Unwind: Frog my unfinished [Color Craving](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/color-craving)
- Hat Halfpipe: [Topographie](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/topographie) 
- Cross Cowling: [Volutissimo](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/volutissimo)

These projects allowed me to apply for eight medals.

I had trouble deciding which colors to use for the Varia hat, so I went with a different
pattern.  My Topographie project is also my hat for February.

I'm not sure if I really want to participate next year, but if I do, I ought to plan ahead
and choose my projects as wisely as possible.  I started working on a 
[Farthing](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/farthing) scarf, and I wasn't able to
knit it quickly enough.  I could have finished something else, but I didn't have a great
plan for choosing projects.  I just knit what I wanted to work on.
