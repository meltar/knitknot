### Notes
I knit the larger size hat.

I'm not sure this is the best yarn for the project, but it turned out an interesting texture.
I have to remind myself not to buy any more verigated yarn.

I actually bought this yarn for a Christmas project in 2012, but it didn't work out because I 
didn't want to have gauge issues.  I decided to try using it for my monthly hat project because
it's one of the few DK yarns I had in my stash.

I planned to knit a [Varia](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/varia) hat for this 
Ravellenic Games event, but I couldn't decide on the colors.  I'm pretty happy with my backup
plan.  I'd still like to knit Varia, but I won't start it yet.
