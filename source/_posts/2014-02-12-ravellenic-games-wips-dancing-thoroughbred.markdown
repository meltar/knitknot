## Thoroughbred

{% img left /images/posts/2014/thoroughbred_small1.JPG Finished fingerless gloves %}

### Ravellenic Games Categories
WIPs Dancing  

### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/volutissimo)

### Yarn
Madelintosh Tosh DK - Betine

### Modifications
Knit eight fewer stiches for the circumference of the hand

### Notes
Eight fewer stitches may have been too many.  I ought to have tried using four fewer instead.
I'm still happier with these gloves than the first pair I knit.  Those were way too big.
