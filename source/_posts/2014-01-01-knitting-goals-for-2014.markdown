It's a new year + new blog, and that means it's time for some new knitting goals.

### Goals for 2014:

- Submit the level 1 of the [TKGA Master Knitting Program](http://www.tkga.com/?page=AboutTKGAMasters) by July 1, 2014
- Knit a new hat each month
- Knit a [bear sweater](http://atlantaknittingguild.org/community-service/bear-sweaters/) each month
- Knit two sweaters
- Document previous projects
- Continue blogging!

Bear sweaters will be submitted to the [Atlanta Knitting Guild](http://atlantaknittingguild.org/) project for the [Georgia Center for Child Advocacy](http://georgiacenterforchildadvocacy.org/)

I was going to include a goal that involves buying less yarn, but since I've already failed at that one, I'll make a more realistic goal later.

Coincidentally, my friend Katy also wants to knit a sweater this year, so we're going to work on our sweater 
projects at the same time.  I still need to decide what to make.
