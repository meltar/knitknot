You can view the original guide on Outfit Posts for this set [here](http://www.outfitposts.com/2013/02/one-suitcase-winter-vacation-capsule.html).

The idea is that with sixteen pieces of clothing, you can mix and match them to make forty 
different outfits.

This is one of the vacation set,s but it's pretty close to my normal winter
wardrobe for work.

## Notes
It looks like I need to knit a couple of items (a cable knit sweater and mustard scarf), and
start looking to fill some of the other missing ones.

One of the main things I noticed is that my current closet lacks layering pieces.  I prefer
sweaters with little or no ease, but I need more diversity if I want to mix and match pieces
more easily.

I need to spend some time thinking before I buy anything, but I'm looking forward to completing
this set by next year.
