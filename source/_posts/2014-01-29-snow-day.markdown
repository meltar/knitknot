It snowed! I haven't seen snow in a few years, so I wanted to stomp around and get some
pictures today.  I added the Ruby design to these mittens, and they are quite popular since
I've been working in Ruby on Rails at my most recent job and in my free time.

Coincidentally, all these patterns were designed by [Jane Richmond](http://janerichmond.blogspot.com/).
I've knit quite a few of her patterns.
