### Notes
I picked this project for several reasons.  I was trying to find a project that fit the criteria
for the [EatSleepKnit](http://eatsleepknit.com) Yarnathon event for the first quarter of 2014.
The challenge was to knit something with ESK yarn that used a skill that's new to you.  I 
chose to use my lovely Sweetgeorgia Yarn to knit this cowl with dropped stitches.  I've knit
lace projects, but not dropped stitches.  I was a little disappointed because I still want
to try dropped stitches that require me to drop the stitch multiple rows, but this was still
a good experience.

I also wanted to knit this for the Ravellenic Games.  I picked a cowl because I didn't have 
any plans for that category.  I had a hard time choosing between a cowl with dropped stitches
and a scarf with dropped stitches.

The only problem I had was caused by my brilliant idea of alternating skeins because the two
skeins I bought looked pretty different.  One had much more saturated colors.  I foolishly
tried to alternate past one of the dropped stich rows, and it looked really bad.  When I got
halfway done, I stopped alternating because I was tired of it.  After binding off, I went back
and did surgery on the first dropped stitch row.  I was able to make it look much better by 
cutting the yarn that was too tight and zig-zagging some new yarn though that section.
