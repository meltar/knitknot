I was reminded of the "One Suitcase" series on [outfitposts.com](http://outfitposts.com) when
I was looking at some other blog posts, and I realized this is a great guide to cleaning out
my closets.  Going through all of my clothes and reducing what I have is one of my goals for
2014, and honestly, I've been kind of overwhelmed by the process.  I think having some structure
to making decisions and identifying weak spots in my wardrobe will help me a lot.

Despite not being directly related to knitting, thinking about clothing and outfits is really
important.  Sometimes I forget to ask myself if I'm buying yarn that I will actually wear later,
and even though I'm getting better at planning what I'll wear, I don't have a clear idea of what
my wardrobe should be.

There are eight different suitcase collections on the Outfit Posts site, and I thought it would
be easiest to start with the winter vacation set, and the beach vacation guide should be an
excellent guide to choosing clothes for this summer.  

I rarely wear business casual clothes, and my current collection is both outdated and lacking 
focus, so I'll keep what I can and start building something better. If I build these three 
wardrobe areas, I should be much happier with my closet.
