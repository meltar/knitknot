## Beary Easy Sweater

### Designer
[Pattern](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/beary-easy-sweater) by Diana Rishel

### Yarn
Cascade 220 Superwash - Sunset Orange  

Purchased at [Silver Threads and Golden Needles](http://www.silverthreadsyarn.com/)

### Modifications
I added a few rows of garter stitch at the bottom of the body to make it curl less.

Also, I attached a crochet chain ties to each side of the front.

### Notes
This sweater was supposed to be completed in January, so it's already late, but I was able to knit it
pretty quickly. I still need to block it, but there's no rush.  I don't need to turn in my sweaters till
the end of the year.
